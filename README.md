# LBXplode

[LBXplode](http://burningsmell.org/lbxplode/) is a extremely simple app for dumping the contents of Master of Orion I/II .lbx files. It also auto-identifies contained WAV files and gives them the correct file extension. It uses SDL for endian conversion, so theoretically this should work on big-endian platforms, not just it's native little-endian one. Usage is extremely simple:

```sh
lbxplode file
```

Did you know that the phrase 'cats rule dogs drool' is contained many times in Master of Orion II data files? Odd that.
